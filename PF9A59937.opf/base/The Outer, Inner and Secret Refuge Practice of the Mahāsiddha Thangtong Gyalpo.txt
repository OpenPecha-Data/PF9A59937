The Outer, Inner and Secret Refuge Practice of the Mahāsiddha Thangtong Gyalpo
revealed to Ka Ngapa Paljor Sherab

ma namkha dang nyampé semchen tamché lama sangye rinpoche la kyab su chi o
All mother sentient beings as infinite as space take refuge in the guru, the precious buddha.
sangye chö dang gendün nam la kyab su chi o
In the Buddha, Dharma and Saṅgha, we take refuge.
lama yidam khandrö tsok la kyab su chi o
In the assembly of gurus, yidam deities and ḍākinīs, we take refuge.
rangsem tongsal chö kyi ku la kyab su chi o
In the dharmakāya, the inseparable emptiness and clarity of our own minds, we take refuge.

This prayer carries the blessing of Avalokiteśvara, who transmitted it to the Lord of Dharma
Ka Ngapa and told him to give it to Gelong Tsöndru Zangpo (Thangtong Gyalpo), saying that
if he taught it to the people of this world, it would dispel all sickness, negative influences
and obstacles right now, and then also grant protection from the lower realms. Virtue!
