An Aspiration Prayer Composed by the Master Mahāsiddha Thangtong Gyalpo in the Presence of the
Jowo Rinpoche in Lhasa, known as  “The Vajra Words That Radiate Cloud-Masses of Nectar-Like
Blessings”
by Thangtong Gyalpo

tayé drowa ngepar drol ledu
First, you generated the supreme mind of unsurpassable awakening
lamé changchub chok tu tukkyé né
Firmly set upon the liberation of sentient beings in their infinitude,
tsok nyi dzok dzé gyalwa tukjé chen
Then, you perfected the two accumulations, O compassionate Victorious One,
gönmé nyikmé dro la tser gong né
You whose love embraces beings bereft of any protector in these degenerate times:
trekom nyamtak dukngal gyi zirwé
Protect them without fail!
lüchen didak ngepar kyab chirdu
For these beings plagued by hunger, thirst, difficulties, and suffering,
rinchen zé nor dru dang mal cha sok
Release upon the world and the Land of Snows
yi ong dögü longchö jinyé kyi
A rain of all the pleasant things the senses can enjoy,
charpa dzamling khawachen du pob
Including jewels, food, wealth, grain, and bedding!
dümin lung dang mé ten charchu sok
Pacify harm among the four elements,
jung shyi nöpa nyewar shyiwa dang
Untimely wind and fire, or inauspicious rains and waters!
dru chü tsitok lotok lasokpa
Let grains, plants, harvests and the like
dzokden dü tar min ching gyé gyur chik
Mature fully, just as in the golden age!
jam dang nyingjé shuk kyi rang kul né
Through the strength of aspirations such as these,
gyachen mönlam tabpa di yi tü
Inspired by loving-kindness and compassion,
né tsön mugé kalwa nyershyi né
May sicknesses, weapons, and famines be thoroughly pacified
tsering nemé dekyi denpar shok
And beings enjoy long life, good health, well-being and happiness!
gyalwa sé dang chepé tukjé dang
Through the power of the compassion of the victorious ones and their heirs,
lé dré luwa mepé den tob kyi
And the infallible power of the interdependence of causes and results,
gyalwé tenpa dar shying gyepa dang
May the teachings of the Victorious One spread and flourish,
dro kün lamé changchub nyur tob shok
And all beings swiftly reach unsurpassable awakening!

This aspiration prayer was made by the realized master Thangtong Gyalpo in the presence of the
Jowo Rinpoche in Lhasa at a time when Tibet—particularly Kham—was struck by a great famine.
The power of this prayer saved the Tibetan people from sufferings brought on by hunger
and thirst, for at that time the noble Avalokiteśvara poured down a rain of grains from
the sky.
